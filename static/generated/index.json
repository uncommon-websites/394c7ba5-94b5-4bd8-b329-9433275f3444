    "prompt": "A candid, documentary-style photograph of a small group of indie game developers and gamers in an underground creative workspace. The scene is set in a converted warehouse with exposed brick and moody, atmospheric lighting—deep shadows, dramatic side-lighting, and selective pops of electric blue from LED strips and clothing accents. The environment feels lived-in and authentic, with cluttered desks, scattered coffee cups, and unique collectibles visible. The subjects are in the midst of focused collaboration and intense discussion, their expressions showing concentration and subtle satisfaction. The composition uses rule of thirds and architectural framing (like doorways or windows), with a 60/40 split between people and their atmospheric environment, creating depth and visual tension. There are no screens, tech devices, or visible text—just authentic human moments and the creative energy of the space.",
