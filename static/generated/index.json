The scene is set in a converted warehouse with exposed brick and moody, atmospheric lighting—deep shadows, dramatic side-lighting, and selective pops of electric blue from LED strips and clothing accents. The environment feels lived-in and authentic, with cluttered desks, scattered coffee cups, and unique collectibles visible.

The composition uses rule of thirds and architectural framing (like doorways or windows), with a 60/40 split between people and their atmospheric environment, creating depth and visual tension. There are no screens, tech devices, or visible text—just authentic human moments and the creative energy of the space.",
